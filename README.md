### Installation
**Do I need to install pip?**

pip is already installed if you're using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 binaries downloaded from python.org, but you'll need to upgrade pip.

**Additionally, pip will already be installed if you're working in a Virtual Environment created by [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#virtualenv) or [pyvenv](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#venv).**

>Installing with get-pip.py

To install pip, securely download [get-pip.py.](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)

Then run the following:

`python get-pip.py`

>Warning

>Be cautious if you're using a Python install that's managed by your operating system or another package manager. get-pip.py does not coordinate with those tools, and may leave your system in an inconsistent state.
